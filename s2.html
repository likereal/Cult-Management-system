        can cause them to be afraid of life and people around them. This sect tries to help the members overcome their trauma and fears through rehablitation. We teach the members to accept the things that happened as it made them who they are and not
        forget it or hide it deep inside them. Your past life is like soil it is up to you whether to let the soil go barren or plant exotic plants and add organic compost and to make it beautiful. It is your job to take care of them , yes we can help
        but you are the most responsible says
