        The experience has helped me with my family problems at home but now I have a new family that gives me more love and attention than they ever did. My new family helped me peacefully move them to the basement for the rest of their lives. They do nothing
        but sleep all day! Thank you and I am proud to be an oracle of the end

        The experience helped me accept my past and gave me a chance to start life anew with a reason to live. It has taught me that the people around me are toxic and I need to cut them out of my life, so I did and now I have their heads as taxidermy. Thank
        you and I am proud to be an oracle of the end

        The experience has helped me through my marital affairs that I had with my husband and made me realize that we were never a thing to begin with. I now am free from all materialistic concepts and sometimes a strange shadowy figure visits me at sharp 12am
        and watches me sleep. I enjoy his company as he helps me cope with the guilt. Thank you and I am proud to be an oracle of the End

        The experience has helped me come to terms with my down syndrome. I was always bullied and told I was a mistake not only by my friends but also my family.My new family showed me god and he told me to cut them off which I did.Now my old family and friends
        don't exist more but what I do have is my new found family. Thank you and I am proud to be an oracle of the end

        The experience has helped me cope with my depression of having a bad limbido and also a huge neck. I was shunned by everyone, called a freak and women shamed me for thinking I had a chance.But thanks to these people I am now free from such people.My neck
        and limbido may still be the same but I have learnt to accept it without a worry in my mind.These people have also showed me that I still have a chance with infants which I do. Thank you and I am proud to be an oracle of the End
