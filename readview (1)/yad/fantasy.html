            <p class="synopsis">Percy Jackson is a good kid, but he can't seem to focus on his schoolwork or 
                control his temper. And lately, being away at boarding school is only getting worse - Percy 
                could have sworn his pre-algebra teacher turned into a monster and tried to kill him. When 
                Percy's mom finds out, she knows it's time that he knew the truth about where he came from, 
                and that he go to the one place he'll be safe. She sends Percy to Camp Half Blood, a summer 
                camp for demigods (on Long Island), where he learns that the father he never knew is Poseidon, 
                God of the Sea. Soon a mystery unfolds and together with his friendsâ€”one a satyr and the other 
                the demigod daughter of Athena - Percy sets out on a quest across the United States to reach 
                the gates of the Underworld (located in a recording studio in Hollywood) and prevent a 
                catastrophic war between the gods.

            <p class="synopsis">High-school student Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart), always a bit of a misfit, 
                doesn't expect life to change much when she moves from sunny Arizona to rainy Washington 
                state. Then she meets Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), a handsome but mysterious teen 
                whose eyes seem to peer directly into her soul. Edward is a vampire whose family does not 
                drink blood, and Bella, far from being frightened, enters into a dangerous romance with her 
                immortal soulmate.

            <p class="synopsis">Harry Potter's life is miserable. His parents are dead and he's stuck with 
                his heartless relatives, who force him to live in a tiny closet under the stairs. But his
                 fortune changes when he receives a letter that tells him the truth about himself: he's a 
                 wizard.
                 He is taken to his new home, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Though Harry's 
                 first year at Hogwarts is the best of his life, not everything is perfect. There is a 
                 dangerous secret object hidden within the castle walls, and Harry believes it's his 
                 responsibility to prevent it from falling into evil hands. But doing so will bring him 
                 into contact with forces more terrifying than he ever could have imagined.
