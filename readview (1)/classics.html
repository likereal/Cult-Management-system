            <p class="synopsis">The story is of the fabulously wealthy Jay Gatsby and his new love for the 
                beautiful Daisy Buchanan, of lavish parties on Long Island at a time when The New York Times 
                noted "gin was the national drink and sex the national obsession," it is an exquisitely 
                crafted tale of America in the 1920s.
                The Great Gatsby is one of the great classics of twentieth-century literature.

            <p class="author">Author: George Orwell</p>
            <p>Originally published: September 3, 2013</p><br>
            <p class="synopsis">Nineteen Eighty-Four is a rare work that grows more haunting as its futuristic 
                purgatory becomes more real. Published in 1949, the book offers political satirist George 
                Orwell's nightmarish vision of a totalitarian, bureaucratic world and one poor stiff's 
                attempt to find individuality. The brilliance of the novel is Orwell's prescience of modern 
                life—the ubiquity of television, the distortion of the language—and his ability to construct 
                such a thorough version of hell. Required reading for students since it was published, it 
                ranks among the most terrifying novels ever written.

            <p class="author">Author: J.D. Salinger</p>
            <p>Originally published: October 1, 1996</p><br>
            <p class="synopsis">The hero-narrator of The Catcher in the Rye is an ancient child of sixteen, 
                a native New Yorker named Holden Caulfield. Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, 
                econdhand description, he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New 
                York City for three days. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born 
                in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but, almost, 
                hopelessly impaled on it. There are many voices in this novel: children's voices, adult voices, 
                underground voices-but Holden's voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own 
                vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry 
                of mixed pain and pleasure. However, like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders, 
                e keeps most of the pain to, and for, himself. The pleasure he gives away, or sets aside, 
                with all his heart. It is there for the reader who can handle it to keep.

            <p class="author">Author: Louisa May Alcott</p>
            <p>Originally published: September 30, 1868</p><br>
            <p class="synopsis">Here are talented tomboy and author-to-be Jo, tragically frail Beth, beautiful 
                Meg, and romantic, spoiled Amy, united in their devotion to each other and their struggles to 
                survive in New England during the Civil War.
                It is no secret that Alcott based Little Women on her own early life. Louisa supported herself 
                and her sisters with "woman’s work,” including sewing, doing laundry, and acting as a domestic 
                servant. But she soon discovered she could make more money writing. Little Women brought her 
                lasting fame and fortune, and far from being the "girl’s book” her publisher requested, it 
                explores such timeless themes as love and death, war and peace, the conflict between personal 
                ambition and family responsibilities, and the clash of cultures between Europe and America.
